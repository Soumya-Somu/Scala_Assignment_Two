# Project Title

Assignment Two

## Getting Started

1. Find the last element of list with its index value(dont use inbuilt methods to extract last element directly).
2. Print the table of each element in the List.
3. Implement Stack and Queue using Lists.

### Prerequisites

I have added the following dependency :

```
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.2.5" % "test"
```
## Implementation

* **ListOperations** : Finding the last element of the list with it's position/index value using tail recursion. Printing multiplication table for each of the elements of the list.

* **QueueBuilder** : Implementation of queue using List and and various methods for it.

* **StackBuilder** : Implementation of stack using List and various methods for it. 

## Test Cases

I have created 14 testcases to test various scenarios.

## Building Tool

* [SBT]

## SBT commands to run and test:

```sbt clean```
```sbt compile```
```sbt run```
```sbt test```
